# Batch Processing Pipeline with AWS CDK

## Overview

This repository contains a template for creating a Batch Processing Pipeline using AWS CDK in Python. The architecture leverages AWS Batch for running batch jobs and Amazon S3 for data input and output. This template serves as a foundational setup to help data engineers quickly establish a scalable batch processing solution.

## Use Case Description

The Batch Processing Pipeline is designed to handle large volumes of data in batches, making it ideal for processing jobs that can be executed periodically. This setup enables organizations to efficiently process data from various sources and deliver results in a timely manner.

### Key Components

- **AWS Batch**: A fully managed batch processing service that dynamically provisions the optimal quantity and type of compute resources based on the volume and specific resource requirements of the batch jobs submitted.
- **Amazon S3**: A scalable storage service used to store input and output data for batch processing jobs.

### File Explanations

- **`app.py`**: This file initializes your AWS CDK application and defines the stack that includes your batch processing resources.
- **`batch_processing_pipeline_stack.py`**: This is the main entry point of your AWS CDK application. It defines the AWS Batch job definition, compute environment, job queue, and S3 bucket.
- **`requirements.txt`**: A file that lists the Python packages required for your CDK application. Ensure to include `aws-cdk-lib` and `constructs`.
- **`permissions.md`**: A separate file detailing the IAM permissions required to execute the batch processing pipeline successfully.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- AWS account with access to AWS Batch and S3.
- AWS CLI configured with your credentials.
- Python environment set up with AWS CDK installed.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CDKTemplate.git
   cd CDKTemplate/BatchProcessingPipeline
2. Install dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Deploy the stack:
    cdk deploy
4. Clean up resources when done:
    cdk destroy
