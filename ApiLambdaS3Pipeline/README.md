# Serverless API for Data Access

## Overview

This repository contains a template for creating a Serverless API using AWS CDK in Python. The architecture utilizes AWS Lambda for backend processing and Amazon API Gateway for API management. This template serves as a foundational setup to help developers quickly establish a serverless API for accessing data stored in Amazon S3.

## Use Case Description

The Serverless API is designed to provide a scalable and efficient way to access data stored in S3. This setup allows applications to interact with the data seamlessly through RESTful API calls, making it suitable for various data-driven applications.

### Key Components

- **AWS Lambda**: A serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources.
- **Amazon API Gateway**: A fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.
- **Amazon S3**: A scalable storage service used to store the data that the API will serve.

### File Explanations

- **`app.py`**: This file initializes your AWS CDK application and defines the stack that includes your serverless API resources.
- **`serverless_data_access_stack.py`**: This is the main entry point of your AWS CDK application. It defines the Lambda function, API Gateway, and S3 bucket.
- **`lambda/access.py`**: The Lambda function code that processes incoming requests and accesses data from S3.
- **`requirements.txt`**: A file that lists the Python packages required for your CDK application. Ensure to include `aws-cdk-lib` and `constructs`.
- **`permissions.md`**: A separate file detailing the IAM permissions required to execute the serverless API setup successfully.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- AWS account with access to AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and S3.
- AWS CLI configured with your credentials.
- Python environment set up with AWS CDK installed.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
