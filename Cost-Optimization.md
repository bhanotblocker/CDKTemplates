## Cost Optimization Strategies
1. **Choose Appropriate Instance Types**: Select lower-cost instance types when starting out, and only scale up as needed.
2. **Use the Free Tier Wisely**: Monitor your usage to ensure you stay within the Free Tier limits.
3. **Automate Start/Stop of Resources**: Use Lambda functions or AWS Step Functions to shut down resources when not in use.
4. **Optimize Data Storage**: Use S3 lifecycle policies to transition data to lower-cost storage classes (e.g., S3 Glacier) when appropriate.
5. **Use Cost Monitoring Tools**: Implement AWS Budgets and Cost Explorer to keep track of spending and optimize accordingly.

By understanding the cost structure and implementing these strategies, users can effectively manage their AWS expenses while leveraging powerful data engineering tools.
