# Real-Time Data Streaming with AWS CDK

## Overview

This repository provides a template for setting up a real-time data streaming architecture using AWS CDK in Python. The architecture leverages Amazon Kinesis for data ingestion, AWS Lambda for real-time processing, and Amazon S3 for data storage. This template helps data engineers quickly establish a scalable, event-driven pipeline for real-time analytics and monitoring.

## Use Case Description

The real-time data streaming architecture is designed to process high-throughput data streams in real-time, enabling organizations to react to events as they happen. This setup is ideal for scenarios like log processing, clickstream analysis, IoT sensor data ingestion, and more.

### Key Components

- **Amazon Kinesis**: A scalable data streaming service used to collect and process large streams of data in real-time. It acts as the primary data ingestion layer.
- **AWS Lambda**: A serverless compute service that allows for the execution of code in response to events. It processes data from Kinesis and performs transformations or enrichments.
- **Amazon S3**: A storage service that stores processed data for further analysis and archival.

### File Explanations

- **`real_time_streaming_stack.py`**: The main entry point of your AWS CDK application. It defines the resources that will be provisioned in AWS, including the Kinesis stream, Lambda function, and S3 bucket. Modify this file to customize your streaming architecture.

- **`lambda/processor.py`**: This is the Lambda function code that processes incoming data from the Kinesis stream. It performs real-time transformations and writes the results to an S3 bucket.

- **`requirements.txt`**: A file listing the Python packages required for your CDK application. This includes `aws-cdk-lib` and other dependencies.

- **`permissions.md`**: A separate file detailing the IAM permissions required for the architecture to function properly. This includes permissions for Kinesis, Lambda, and S3.

- **`app.py`**: This script initializes your AWS CDK application and defines the stack that includes your real-time streaming resources.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- An AWS account with access to Kinesis, Lambda, and S3.
- AWS CLI configured with your credentials.
- Python environment set up with AWS CDK installed.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CDKTemplate.git
   cd CDKTemplate/RealTimeStreaming
2. Install dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Deploy the stack:
    cdk deploy
4. (Optional) Clean up resources when done:
    cdk destroy
