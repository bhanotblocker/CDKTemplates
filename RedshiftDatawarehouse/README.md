# Data Warehouse on Redshift with AWS CDK

## Overview

This repository contains a template for provisioning a Data Warehouse on Amazon Redshift using AWS CDK in Python. This architecture provides a scalable and efficient solution for storing and analyzing large datasets, making it ideal for analytics and reporting.

## Use Case Description

The Data Warehouse on Redshift setup enables organizations to centralize their data for analysis. This template includes ETL capabilities to transform and load data into Redshift from various sources, making data ready for complex queries and reporting.

### Key Components

- **Amazon Redshift**: A fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service that allows you to run complex queries across large datasets.
- **AWS Glue**: A fully managed ETL service that simplifies the process of data preparation, making it easy to extract data from various sources, transform it, and load it into Redshift.
- **Amazon S3**: A scalable storage service used to stage data before loading it into Redshift.

### File Explanations

- **`app.py`**: This file initializes your AWS CDK application and defines the stack that includes your Redshift resources.
- **`redshift_data_warehouse_stack.py`**: This is the main entry point of your AWS CDK application. It defines the Amazon Redshift cluster, Glue jobs, and S3 buckets for staging data.
- **`requirements.txt`**: A file that lists the Python packages required for your CDK application. Ensure to include `aws-cdk-lib` and `constructs`.
- **`permissions.md`**: A separate file detailing the IAM permissions required to execute the data warehouse setup successfully.
