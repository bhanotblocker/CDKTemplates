# Data Lake Architecture with AWS CDK

## Overview

This repository contains a template for creating a Data Lake Architecture using AWS CDK in Python. The architecture leverages Amazon S3 for data storage, AWS Glue for data cataloging, and AWS Athena for querying. This template serves as a foundational setup to help data engineers quickly establish a scalable data lake for analytics.

## Use Case Description

The Data Lake Architecture is designed to store large volumes of structured and unstructured data, allowing organizations to centralize their data for analysis. It enables seamless data ingestion from various sources, making it easier to perform analytics and reporting using tools like AWS Athena.

### Key Components

- **Amazon S3**: A scalable storage service used to store both raw and processed data. It serves as the backbone of the data lake.
- **AWS Glue**: A fully managed ETL service that simplifies data preparation and manages the data catalog, making it easier to discover and query data.
- **AWS Athena**: An interactive query service that allows users to analyze data stored in S3 using standard SQL without the need for complex ETL processes.

### File Explanations

- **`data_lake_architecture_stack.py`**: This is the main entry point of your AWS CDK application. It defines the resources that will be provisioned in AWS, including S3 buckets and Glue databases. Modify this file to set up your infrastructure.

- **`requirements.txt`**: A file that lists the Python packages required for your CDK application. Ensure to include `aws-cdk-lib` and `constructs`.

- **`permissions.md`**: A separate file detailing the IAM permissions required to execute the data lake architecture successfully. This includes permissions for S3, Glue, and Athena.

- **`app.py`**: This script initializes your AWS CDK application and defines the stack that includes your data lake resources.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- AWS account with access to AWS Glue, S3, and Athena.
- AWS CLI configured with your credentials.
- Python environment set up with AWS CDK installed.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CDKTemplate.git
   cd CDKTemplate/DataLakeArchitecture
2. Install dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Deploy the stack :
    cdk deploy
4. Clean up resources when done:
    cdk destroy
